## The Catalog of Design Patterns

This is my work implementing the design patterns from [The Catalog of Design Patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/catalog).
The original works are in pseudocode with code samples in various languages (but excluding JavaScript).
I figured that a good way to learn these patterns was to practice implementing them myself.
